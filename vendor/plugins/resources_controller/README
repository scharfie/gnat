= works with rails edge

resources_controller works with rails edge.

It probably works with 1.2.5.  Hold fire, and check back for details of 1.2.5 and 1.2.3 testing

=== Specs and Coverage
* {SPECDOC}[link:files/SPECDOC.html] lists the specifications
* {RSpec Report}[link:rspec_report.html] is a report of spec pass/fails
* {RCov Report}[link:coverage/index.html] is the rcov report

=== Testing

RSpec is used for testing, so the tests are in <tt>spec/</tt> rather than
<tt>test/</tt> Do rake --tasks for more details.
