# Ferret DRb server Capistrano tasks
# 
# Usage:
# in your Capfile, add acts_as_ferret's recipes directory to your load path and
# load the ferret tasks:
#
# load_paths << 'vendor/plugins/acts_as_ferret/recipes'
# load 'aaf_recipes'
#
# This will hook aaf's DRb start/stop tasks into the standard
# deploy:{start|restart|stop} tasks so the server will be restarted along with
# the rest of your application.
# Also an index directory in the shared folder will be created and symlinked
# into current/ when you deploy.
#
# In order to use the ferret:index:rebuild task, declare the models you intend to
# index in config/deploy.rb:
#
# for a shared index, do:
# set :ferret_single_index_models, [ Model, AnotherModel, YetAnotherModel ]
# This will call Model.rebuild_index( AnotherModel, YetAnotherModel )
#
# for models indexed separately, specify:
# set :ferret_models, [ Model, AnotherModel ]
# This will call Model.rebuild_index and AnotherModel.rebuild_index separately.
#
# The two methods may be combined if you have a shared index, and some models
# indexed separately. 
#
# Like to submit a patch to aaf? Automatically determining the models that use 
# acts_as_ferret so the declaration of these variables in deploy.rb isn't 
# necessary anymore would be really cool ;-)
#
#
# HINT: To be very sure that your DRb server and application are always using
# the same model and schema versions, and you never lose any index updates because
# of the DRb server being restarted in that moment, use the following sequence
# to update your application:
#
# cap deploy:stop deploy:update deploy:migrate deploy:start
#
# That will stop the DRb server after stopping your application, and bring it
# up before starting the application again. Plus they'll never use different
# versions of model classes (which might happen otherwise)
# Downside: Your downtime is a bit longer than with the usual deploy, so be sure to
# put up some maintenance page for the meantime.
